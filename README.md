There are a few configuration options that you can add to your `config.toml` file.  
You can also see the `yaml` example [here](https://github.com/refactorian/docket/blob/main/exampleSite/config.yaml).

```toml
# (Optional) Set Google Analytics if you use it to track your website.
# Always put it on the top of the configuration file, otherwise it won't work
googleAnalytics = "UA-XXXXXXXXX-X"

# (Optional) If you provide a Disqus shortname, comments will be enabled on
# all pages.
disqusShortname = "my-site"

# (Optional) Set this to true if you use capital letters in file names
disablePathToLower = true

# (Optional) Set this to true to enable 'Last Modified by' date and git author
#  information on 'doc' type pages.
enableGitInfo = true

# (Optional) Theme is intended for documentation use, therefore it doesn't render taxonomy.
# You can remove related files with config below
disableKinds = ['taxonomy', 'taxonomyTerm']

[params]
  # (Optional, default dark) Sets color theme: light or dark.
  BookTheme = 'dark'

  # (Optional, default true) Controls table of contents visibility on right side of pages.
  # Start and end levels can be controlled with markup.tableOfContents setting.

  # /static/logo.png then the path would be 'logo.png'
  BookLogo = 'logo.png'

  # When not specified file structure and weights will be used
  # Deprecated, to be removed in June 2022

  # You can also set value to "*" to render all sections to menu
  BookSection = 'docs'

  # Set source repository location.
  # Used for 'Last Modified' and 'Edit this page' links.
  BookRepo = 'https://github.com/refactorian/docket'

  # Specifies commit portion of the link to the page's last modified commit hash for 'doc' page
  # type.
  # Required if 'BookRepo' param is set.
  # Value used to construct a URL consisting of BookRepo/BookCommitPath/<commit-hash>

  BookCommitPath = 'commit'

  # Path must point to the site directory.
  BookEditPath = 'edit/main/exampleSite'

  BookComments = true

  # /!\ This is an experimental feature, might be removed or changed at any time

  BookPortableLinks = true

  # /!\ This is an experimental feature, might be removed or changed at any time
  # (Optional, experimental, default false) Enables service worker that caches visited pages and resources for offline use.
  BookServiceWorker = true
```

### Multi-Language Support

Theme supports Hugo's [multilingual mode](https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/), just follow configuration guide there. You can also tweak search indexing configuration per language in `i18n` folder.

### Page Configuration

You can specify additional params in the front matter of individual pages:

```toml
# Set type to 'docs' if you want to render page outside of configured section or if you render section other than 'docs'
type = 'docs'

# Set page weight to re-arrange items in file-tree menu (if BookMenuBundle not set)
weight = 10

bookFlatSection = false

bookCollapseSection = true

# (Optional) Set true to hide page or section from side menu (if BookMenuBundle not set)
bookHidden = false

bookComments = true

# (Optional) Set to 'false' to exclude page from search index.
bookSearchExclude = true

# (Optional) Set explicit href attribute for this page in a menu (if BookMenuBundle not set)
bookHref = ''
```

### Partials

There are layout partials available for you to easily override components of the theme in `layouts/partials/`.

In addition to this, there are several empty partials you can override to easily add/inject code.

| Empty Partial                                      | Placement                                   |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `layouts/partials/docs/inject/head.html`           | Before closing `<head>` tag                 |
| `layouts/partials/docs/inject/body.html`           | Before closing `<body>` tag                 |
| `layouts/partials/docs/inject/footer.html`         | After page footer content                   |
| `layouts/partials/docs/inject/menu-before.html`    | At the beginning of `<nav>` menu block      |
| `layouts/partials/docs/inject/menu-after.html`     | At the end of `<nav>` menu block            |
| `layouts/partials/docs/inject/content-before.html` | Before page content                         |
| `layouts/partials/docs/inject/content-after.html`  | After page content                          |
| `layouts/partials/docs/inject/toc-before.html`     | At the beginning of table of contents block |
| `layouts/partials/docs/inject/toc-after.html`      | At the end of table of contents block       |

### Extra Customisation

| File                     | Description                                                                           |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `static/favicon.png`     | Override default favicon                                                              |
| `assets/_custom.scss`    | Customise or override scss styles                                                     |
| `assets/_variables.scss` | Override default SCSS variables                                                       |
| `assets/_fonts.scss`     | Replace default font with custom fonts (e.g. local files or remote like google fonts) |
| `assets/mermaid.json`    | Replace Mermaid initialization config                                                 |

### Plugins

There are a few features implemented as pluggable `scss` styles. Usually these are features that don't make it to the core but can still be useful.

| Plugin                            | Description                                                 |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `assets/plugins/_numbered.scss`   | Makes headings in markdown numbered, e.g. `1.1`, `1.2`      |
| `assets/plugins/_scrollbars.scss` | Overrides scrollbar styles to look similar across platforms |

To enable plugins, add `@import "plugins/{name}";` to `assets/_custom.scss` in your website root.

### Hugo Internal Templates

There are a few hugo templates inserted in `<head>`

- [Google Analytics](https://gohugo.io/templates/internal/#google-analytics)
- [Open Graph](https://gohugo.io/templates/internal/#open-graph)

To disable Open Graph inclusion you can create your own empty file `\layouts\_internal\opengraph.html`.
In fact almost empty not quite empty because an empty file looks like absent for HUGO. For example:
```
<!-- -->
```

## Shortcodes

- [Buttons](https://refactorian.github.io/docket/docs/shortcodes/buttons/)
- [Columns](https://refactorian.github.io/docket/docs/shortcodes/columns/)
- [Details](https://refactorian.github.io/docket/docs/shortcodes/details/)
- [Hints](https://refactorian.github.io/docket/docs/shortcodes/hints/)
- [KaTeX](https://refactorian.github.io/docket/docs/shortcodes/katex/)
- [Mermaid](https://refactorian.github.io/docket/docs/shortcodes/mermaid/)
- [Tabs](https://refactorian.github.io/docket/docs/shortcodes/tabs/)

By default, Goldmark trims unsafe outputs which might prevent some shortcodes from rendering. It is recommended to set `markup.goldmark.renderer.unsafe=true` if you encounter problems.

```toml
[markup.goldmark.renderer]
  unsafe = true
```

If you are using `config.yaml` or `config.json`, consult the [configuration markup](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/configuration-markup/)

## Versioning

This theme follows a simple incremental versioning. e.g. `v1.0`, `v2.0` and so on. There might be breaking changes between versions.

If you want lower maintenance, use one of the released versions. If you want to live on the bleeding edge of changes, you can use the `main` branch and update your website when needed.
